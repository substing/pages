			Hello, I am Substing.
			<br>
			<br>
			I have recently completed my bachelor's degree in mathematics. My favorite subjects were number theory and complex analysis. More on math can be found in the math tab.
			<br>
			<br> 
			The main focus of this site is tech. I have an outdated blog in which I wrote posts about binary hacking, a topic which I found difficult but very fulfilling. As I went through college, more and more focus needed to be given to the mathematics, and so less could be given to maintaining this blog. My more recent projects can be found as well. 
			<br><br>
			Now beginning my career in the cyber security field, managing security for cloud based web applications.
			<br><br>
			I built the website myself, just using HTML and CSS.
